# Basic_Onshape_CAD
My Onshape basics

## Base
This was such a short assignment, but I'm already loving Onshape. Its UI is much cleaner than SolidWorks and I'm already enjoying the upgraded undo function.[My document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3437eb23a13443dd36737370/w/78e920bfdc5e496698ae8109/e/bc8c0f61fad3220c2cbcf1c0)

## Mount
This one was very similar to the base.

## Fork
This one was pretty fun. I really like that I can immediately dimension things after creating them, just by typing. It also took me a bit to realize that "midplane" is now "symmetric."

## Tire
This one was pretty straight forward.

## Wheel
This one was really fun. I had one minor issue where the circular pattern wasn't cutting any holes, but it was because I had also accidentally selected the the thing I was trying to cut the holes into.

## Collar
This one was straight forward.

## Axle

## Big Bearing
This one was straight forward.

## Small Bearing
I think it will definitely become a skill to determine when it's best to have two parts in the same studio. Small parts like this it seems obvious for, but most of the parts in the caster have at least one dimension shared with another part.

## Sub-assembly
I had trouble figuring out the mates. Everything wasn't quite lined up. It turns out the first two parts I put together were wrong, after that it was mostly fine. I do find it a little tricky to have Onshape highlight the mate connector I wanted, but it's nothing some fiddling with the mouse can't fix.

## Main Assembly
Most of what I said for the sub-assembly still applies, but I had some new problems too, specifically with the screws. Onshape would repeatedly give an error made me unable to place a new screw. Refreshing the page worked, but I had to do it after each nut and each screw. I also found out the best way to put on nuts and screws is the select the place you want them to go before clicking insert. If you don't there's no telling where they'll go, but it's probably not where you want.
