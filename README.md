# Basic_Onshape_CAD
My Onshape caster assignment. The document is [here](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3437eb23a13443dd36737370/w/78e920bfdc5e496698ae8109/e/c9e638efc333a6a1286b864d).

## Base
This was such a short assignment, but I'm already loving Onshape. Its UI is much cleaner than SolidWorks and I'm already enjoying the upgraded undo function.

## Mount
This one was very similar to the base.

## Fork
This one was pretty fun. I really like that I can immediately dimension things after creating them, just by typing. It also took me a bit to realize that "midplane" is now "symmetric."

## Tire
This one was pretty straight forward.

## Wheel
This one was really fun. I had one minor issue where the circular pattern wasn't cutting any holes, but it was because I had also accidentally selected the the thing I was trying to cut the holes into. I also kind want to know if I can change how after creating a line it immediately makes a new one at the end point of the one I just made. I don't always want to make enclosed shapes. That's a very minor annoyance though, in the face of all the good that Onshape is.

## Collar
This one was straight forward.

## Big Bearing
This one was straight forward.

## Small Bearing
I think it will definitely become a skill to determine when it's best to have two parts in the same studio. Small parts like this it seems obvious for, but most of the parts in the caster have at least one dimension shared with another part.

## Sub-assembly
I had trouble figuring out the mates. Everything wasn't quite lined up. It turns out the first two parts I put together were wrong, after that it was mostly fine. I do find it a little tricky to have Onshape highlight the mate connector I wanted, but it's nothing some fiddling with the mouse can't fix.

## Main Assembly
Most of what I said for the sub-assembly still applies, but I had some new problems too, specifically with the screws. Onshape would repeatedly give an error made me unable to place a new screw. Refreshing the page worked, but I had to do it after each nut and each screw. I also found out the best way to put on nuts and screws is the select the place you want them to go before clicking insert. If you don't there's no telling where they'll go, but it's probably not where you want.

## Dowel Pin Frame
This assignment was fine. I really like the onshape configurations because they were a nightmare with SolidWorks. I did find the measure tool a little lacking, but it's a minor thing really. After miscounting the number of pins I needed I got this together without a hitch.

## Universal Joint Challenge
This one was fun. It really illuminated some of the differences between Onshape and SolidWorks because the directions were for SolidWorks, but we did it in Onshape. For the cube, I learned I could use mate connectors like circles that are on every face. I used it for my circular pattern. For the bracket, I went with a sweep, so I drew the sketch of rectangle perpendicular to the sketch of the path I wanted it swept along. For the mates I used two cylindrical mates and two revolute mates, which worked well. To get my animation I right clicked on one of the cylindric from the list on the left and clicked animate. I then selected my degrees of freedom and changed it from reciprocate to loop. After that, I was free to gaze at it at my leisure.
